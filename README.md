This is my version of the Shapes Inc. integration with Discord.

-All you need for the variants is:

-SHAPESINC_SHAPE_USERNAME => The name of the model. Example: shapesinc/itzbiaia-bnbf (this one is mine).

-DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN => Your bot's token.

-SHAPESINC_API_KEY => Your shape's token.

-DISCORD_GUILD_ID => The server ID where you want the bot to speak.

-DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID => The channel ID where you want the bot to speak.

Libraries (obligatory):

-discord.py (version >=2.5.2) - To create and manage the Discord bot

-Flask (version >=3.1.1) - To create the web server that runs the bot

-OpenAI (version >=1.95.1) - To make calls to the Shapes.inc API (which uses the OpenAI interface)
